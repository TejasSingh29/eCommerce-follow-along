## MILESTONE1 :-
1. Set Up the Development Environment
Installed all the necessary tools and dependencies to set up the development environment for the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project. This includes configuring the backend and frontend dependencies to ensure smooth development.
2. Understand Server-Client Interaction
Gained an understanding of how the frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express) using APIs. Focused on how the client sends requests to the server, and how the server processes them and sends back responses.
3. Set Up a Simple Server
Created a basic server using Node.js and Express, laying the foundation for the project. The server is set up to handle API requests and provide a foundation for future endpoints and business logic.

---
## MILESTONE 2  :-
1. Create a Structured Folder Hierarchy
Designed and implemented a structured folder hierarchy for the project, organizing the files in a way that ensures easy maintainability and scalability for both the frontend and backend.
2. Set Up React App (Frontend) and Node.js Server (Backend)
Frontend: Set up a React app to serve as the user interface for the project.
Backend: Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle API requests, providing the foundation for server-side logic and database interaction.
3. Configure Tailwind CSS for Styling
Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS into the project to streamline the styling process and improve the overall design flexibility with utility-first CSS.
4. Add Optional Extensions for Development Efficiency
Installed and configured optional extensions such as Prettier, ESLint, and others to improve code formatting, quality, and overall development workflow.
